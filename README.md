# ðŸ’¡ Week 3: GitOps Workflow for Automation and Cost Optimization

This project introduces a comprehensive GitOps workflow designed to enhance automation and optimize costs. At its core, it implements GitOps principles by leveraging pull requests to facilitate code reviews, status checks, and discussions before applying any changes to the live infrastructure. The workflow employs fully automated CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions and features a robust branching strategy to manage infrastructure and application pipelines independently.

- **Cloud cost optimization** with cost estimation tools like InfraCost.  
- **GitOps workflows** for seamless automation.  
- **Terraform + Ansible integration** for infrastructure management and monitoring stack setup.  
- **Git branching strategies** for streamlined CI/CD pipelines.  

## Infrastructure Pipeline
Provisions and manages infrastructure using Terraform. Provides real-time cost analysis and optimization insights via Infracost. Triggers an Ansible workflow to configure servers and deploy a monitoring stack with dynamic dashboards, instantly accessible via custom domains.

## Application Pipeline
1. **CI pipelines**: Build Docker images for the application and update the deployment file (docker-compose.yml) with the latest image tag. Tags are structured using the workflow run number and short commit SHA for precise traceability (e.g., maestrops/backend:4-0a3087a).
2. **CD pipelines**: Deploy applications only after pull requests are merged, ensuring all changes are reviewed and approved. Post-deployment, applications are accessible through static configurations managed by Traefik.
## Security Enhancements
To maintain robust security: GitHub Actions repository secrets are used for managing sensitive variables. Environment files (.env) for applications are generated dynamically at runtime and securely destroyed after deployment.
## Key Improvements
This iteration emphasizes automation and cost optimization through a GitOps-centric approach. While it continues to utilize the same application source code from Weeks 1 and 2, this setup integrates:

- GitOps principles for streamlined workflows.
- Real-time cost estimation to enhance financial efficiency.
- Dynamic infrastructure and application management pipelines for better scalability and maintainability.
## Objectives
1. **Implement GitOps Principles**: Utilize pull requests to enforce code reviews, discussions, and automated checks, ensuring high-quality changes before deployment.
2. **Enhance Automation Across Pipelines**: Develop fully automated CI/CD pipelines to reduce manual intervention and improve workflow efficiency for infrastructure and applications.
3. **Optimize Infrastructure Costs**: Integrate cost analysis and optimization tools, such as Infracost, to monitor and minimize infrastructure expenses proactively.
4. **Streamline Deployment Processes**: Ensure seamless, traceable deployments by leveraging GitHub Actions, Docker image tagging, and Traefik for static configurations.
5. **Strengthen Security Measures**: Use GitHub Actions repository secrets to protect sensitive data and dynamically generate and securely destroy application environment files.
6. **Improve Monitoring and Observability**: Deploy a monitoring stack with dynamic, custom dashboards for real-time insights into application and infrastructure performance.
7. **Promote Scalability and Maintainability**: Create independent pipelines for infrastructure and application management, enabling easy scalability and future enhancements.
8. **Facilitate Cost-Effective Infrastructure Management**: Leverage Terraform and Ansible to automate provisioning and configuration while maintaining a focus on cost-effectiveness.

### **Components** 
--- 
#### **1. Infrastructure Provisioning (Terraform)**

- **Compute Resources**: AWS EC2 instances for hosting the application and monitoring stacks.
- **Networking Resources**: Configures VPC, subnets, security groups, and internet gateways.
- **DNS Management**: Adds A-record entries in AWS Route53 pointing to EC2 public IPs.
- **Integration with Ansible**:
  1. Dynamically generates inventory.ini files.
  2. Triggers Ansible playbooks post-provisioning.

#### **2. Application Stack**
- **Frontend:** React-based user interface.
- **Backend:** FastAPI for handling API requests.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for persistent data storage.
- **Reverse Proxy:** Traefik for path-based routing between services and SSL management.

#### **3. Monitoring Stack**
- **Prometheus** Collects and stores application metrics.
- **Grafana** Provides visualizations with preconfigured dashboards for cAdvisor and Loki.
- **cAdvisor** Monitors container-level metrics.
- **Loki** Aggregates logs from the application and system.
- **Promtail** Collects logs from the application and system.

### ðŸŒ² **Branch Setup**  

1. **Infrastructure Pipelines:**  
   - `infra_features`: Used for writing and testing Terraform changes.  
   - `infra_main`: Main branch for infrastructure.  

2. **Application Pipelines:**  
   - `integration`: Contains the CI pipeline for building and tagging images.  
   - `deployment`: Contains the CD pipeline for deploying the application stack.  

---

### ðŸ“‹ **Workflow Details**  

#### **Infrastructure Pipeline**  
**Branches: `infra_features` â†’ `infra_main`**  
- **Push to `infra_features`:**  
  - Run `terraform validate` to check the correctness of configurations.  
- **PR to `infra_main`:**  
  - Trigger `terraform plan`, output the plan as a comment in the PR, including cost estimation (e.g., using InfraCost).  
- **Merge to `infra_main`:**  
  - Run `terraform apply` with auto-approval to provision resources.  
  - Trigger Ansible to deploy the monitoring stack on the provisioned infrastructure.  

#### **Application Pipeline**  
**Branches: `integration` â†’ `deployment`**  
- **Push to `integration`:**  
  - Build and tag Docker images for the application.  
  - Push images to a public Docker Hub repository.  
  - Update `docker-compose.yml` with the new image tags and commit the changes.  

- **Merge from `integration` to `deployment`:**  
  - Deploy the application stack to the provisioned infrastructure.  

##### **Workflow Organization:**  
   - Separate `.yml` files for each pipeline.
        - terraform-validate.yml
        - terraform-plan.yml
        - terraform-apply.yml
        - ansible-monitoring.yml
        - ci-application.yml
        - cd-application.yml
